# Demo Story

- Three active builds exist: `GW-993-SPD-09`, `GW-F26-08`, `GW-993-TRB-11`.
- The Turbo build (`GW-993-TRB-11`) is on HOLD due to a critical engine bearing shortage.
- Engine core `RS40-ENG-0011` is in REBUILD (core recovery) status.
- Work orders include an engine rebuild for the RS40 core.
- Inventory shows `ENG_BEARING_SET_993` at zero on-hand with active demand.
- Parts catalog includes thousands of SKUs, fasteners, and custom in-house parts.
- Tasks and events prove non-linear workflow with PAUSE/RESUME/BLOCK.
- Current focus phase is derived from the latest IN_PROGRESS activity.
- Build BOM shows required vs allocated vs consumed quantities.
- Documents tab references a build book placeholder for scanned PDFs.
